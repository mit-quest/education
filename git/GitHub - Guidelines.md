# Process

We use the following flow for managing shared software stacks that people need to make edits to...



*   Create a **BRANCH** for every discrete bug fix or feature addition with a meaningful name such as kyle/fixing-terraform-authentication. 
*   **COMMIT** your edits to that branch and try to ensure you havenâ€™t broken anything else, continuous integration is not likely to be useful for small projects 
*   Open a **PULL REQUEST** from Master once a branch has the core functionality committed. Make sure to describe the purpose of the pull request and link any relevant GitHub Issues.
*   **TAG** appropriate team members and your supervisor as a reviewer
*   **DISCUSS** and iterate on edits
*   All reviewers must **APRROVE** the pull request
*   The creator of the pull request will then **MERGE** and **DELETE** branch
