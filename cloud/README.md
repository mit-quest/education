This directory serves as a starting point with information to help you process machine learning tasks on different popular cloud providers. Below are the current directories.

[Google Cloud Platform](GCP)  
[Satori](Satori)  

Many people use the cloud for machine learning in order to gain access to GPUs, Graphics Processing Units. Compared to CPUs, GPUs are important because they have many cores and are better for parallel processing with many tasks at once. This makes machine learning much more efficient. Working on the cloud also gives space for much more storage within buckets than can be easily stored locally. 

It's often possible to get a free trial or free credits on cloud websites. For those within the MIT community, please look [here](https://bridge.mit.edu/credits/) to look into the process of receiving free credits through MIT.
