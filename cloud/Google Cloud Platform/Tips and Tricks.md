## [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) - Tips and Tricks

### Known Gotchas

*   [gsutil cp](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/cp)
    *   **Use -m to ensure multithreading**
        *   gsutil **-m** ...
    *   Use -r for directories
        *   gsutil -m cp **-r** src dest

## [GCP Compute Engine (VMs)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)

### Tips and Tricks

* It is sometimes useful to spin up common configs, for instance:
  * [Pre-confirgured Tensor VM](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/deep-learning-vm/docs/tensorflow_start_instance)


## [GCS Fuse](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcs-fuse)

### Known Gotchas

*   [--implicit-dirs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/blob/master/docs/semantics.md)
    *   We ran into this issue where we uploaded data into a bucket using gsutil and then tried to mount it using GCS Fuse and got a weird behaviour where it wouldnâ€™t find the directories, the solution was to use --implicit-dirs when mounting in order to have it discover the pseudo directories that gsutil created.
